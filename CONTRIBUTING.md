# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! A few quick guidelines:

- Open a PR with a clear description of the change and link to any relevant issue.
- Keep changes small and focused; follow existing code style.
- For JS formatting we prefer small, readable functions; no minified files in PRs.
